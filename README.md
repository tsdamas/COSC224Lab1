# COSC224Lab1 - Lab 1 - GitHub

## Project Overview
This project is an **Interactive Quiz**, created as part of Lab 1 for GitHub practice.  
The goal of this lab is to practice using Git and GitHub to create repositories, work with branches, and use pull requests to merge changes.  
The quiz was designed with simple functionality, focusing on Git/GitHub workflows rather than complex features.

## Features Implemented
The project includes:
- **Quiz Questions**: Four interactive multiple-choice questions covering CIS-related topics.
- **HTML Structure**: Clean and semantic HTML code for the quiz layout.
- **Form Handling**: A structure allowing users to select and submit answers.
- **Dynamic Results Section**: A section to display the quiz results (JavaScript functionality to be added in future improvements).

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tsdamas/COSC224Lab1.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd COSC224Lab1
   ```
3. Open the `questions.html` file in any browser to view and interact with the quiz.

## GitHub Workflow
- **Repository**: A GitHub repository was created to host the project.
- **Branches**: The following branches were used to implement specific features:
  1. `thais-add-questions-list`: Created the basic HTML structure for the quiz.
  2. `juliana-add-style`: Added CSS for layout and design.
  3. `thais-add-iterativity`: Implemented JavaScript logic for processing quiz answers.
  4. `juliana-add-image`: Added an image to enhance the quiz design.
  5. `thais-add-footer`: Added a footer section with additional information or navigation links.
  6. `juliana-update-reade.me`: Created and updated the README file.
- **Pull Requests**: Changes from each branch were reviewed and merged into the `main` branch following proper pull request practices.
- **Main Branch**: The `main` branch contains the final working version of the code.

## Partner Collaboration
This project was completed by:
- [Juliana Nina](https://github.com/juliananina)
- [Thais Damasceno](https://github.com/tsdamas)

Each partner contributed by working on separate branches and reviewing each other's code through pull requests. 
Collaboration ensured the project met all the assignment requirements.

## Task Details
The interactive quiz includes the following:
- **Question 1**: What does CIS stand for?
- **Question 2**: Which programming language is commonly taught in the CIS program?
- **Question 3**: Which is the best way to reach Professor Ken?
- **Question 4**: Which of the following is the worst password to use?

The quiz is designed to be simple yet interactive, demonstrating Git/GitHub practices.

## Submission
This project fulfills the following submission requirements:
1. **GitHub Repository**: A repository with meaningful commit messages and proper branch names.
2. **Five Branches**: At least five branches were used to implement features.
3. **Pull Requests**: Proper pull requests were created with detailed descriptions and comments.
4. **Final Code in Main Branch**: The final version of the project exists in the `main` branch.
5. **README File**: This file describes the project, its features, and how it was developed.
